# About me :)

## Education

I am studying Applied Informatics at Cracow University of Economics

## Projects

- ### Ceneo Scraper (cSkrapy)
It's a web scraping tool designed to gather product reviews from [Ceneo](Ceneo.pl) for further analysis and data visualization.  

- ### RPG game
I spend most of my free time developing a [RPG game](https://github.com/NeoNeqs/rpg). It doesn't have a name yet, though I call it "Project Nightfall". The game is my playground to learn game development and systems design.

## Hobbies

- **Game Programming** - Most of my game programming happens in Godot.

- **System Design** — I'm especially interested in **network infrastructure design** (like laying out the network architecture for services or multiplayer games), as well as designing **itemization systems and combat mechanics in RPG games** — balancing stats, abilities, and game loops to create engaging and meaningful player experiences.

- **Reverse Engineering** — I love scouring through decompiled code to find vulnerabilities or patches. From time to time I try to solve some CTF challanges.
